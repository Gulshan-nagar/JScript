# Project Description

## Introduction to JScript
JScript is a lightweight programming language 'JScript' designed for simplicity and clarity, along with an accompanying Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The project focuses on providing a clear syntax, user-friendly IDE, and easy-to-understand documentation, making it suitable for beginners to understand how programming works.

The primary objective behind developing this programming language is to gain a foundational understanding of how professional programming languages operate. Additionally, this project provides an opportunity to learn JavaScript in greater depth, ensuring a thorough grasp of its concepts and applications.

This project marks our first significant undertaking, offering invaluable experience in team collaboration. It allows us to work together, navigating the challenges that inevitably arise during the development process. Through this hands-on experience, we address various issues as they emerge, fostering a deeper understanding of problem-solving in a collaborative environment. This initiative not only strengthens our technical skills but also enhances our ability to work effectively as a team in real-world development scenarios.

## Video Walkthrough of the project
Attach a very short video walkthough of all of the features [ 1 - 3 minutes ]

## Features
- **Custom Programming Language**: Includes support for variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions.
- **Interactive IDE**: User-Friendly IDE, Syntax highlighting, error detection, and a console for output.
- **Clear Documentation**: Simple, beginner-friendly documentation to help users get started.
- **Helpfull for Beginners**: Very Useful for beginners who want to learn Programming language.

## Design decisions or assumptions
- The language is interpreted in the browser for simplicity.
- The IDE is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy accessibility.
- Features like syntax highlighting are implemented using basic DOM manipulation for demonstration purposes.

## Example Syntax

- For declaring variables

        x = 10 or x = ""

- For printing values

        x or "Hello"

- For using if else statements

        x = 5

        if (x > 3) {
            "X is greater than 3"
        }
        else {
            "X is not greater than 3"
        }

- For using loops

        x = ""

        for ( i = 0; i < 11; i++ ){
            x += i + " " 
        }

        x

- For using Functions

        function greet(){
            "Hello User"
        }

        greet()
